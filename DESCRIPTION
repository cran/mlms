Description: Analysis-ready datasets detailing the Multilevel Monitoring System (MLMS)
    wells within the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) aquifer-monitoring network at
    the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho, and the data collected within these
    wells. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the USGS collected
    discrete measurements of hydraulic head at various depths from wells in the
    eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) aquifer over several years. These measurements
    were derived from data on fluid pressure, fluid temperature, and atmospheric
    pressure. Each well was equipped with an MLMS, which included valved measurement
    ports, packer bladders, casing segments, and couplers. The MLMS facilitated
    monitoring at multiple hydraulically isolated depth intervals, reaching
    significant depths below the land surface. Additionally, groundwater samples
    were collected from these wells over multiple years and analyzed for various
    chemical and physical parameters.
